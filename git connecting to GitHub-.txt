git connecting to GitHub:-
git config --global user.name username
git congif --global user.email emaild

check the username and mailid :-
git config user.name
git config user.email

1.create new folder in that folder go to address bar and delete the address and type cmd. cmd will open
 
2.we can change the directory with repository name:-
cd jrs_github(it is a git repository name)

3.dir

4.git status (it shows how many files are present in this folder)

5.we can also create new files in the local git and check using 
git status (then our file is visible in red colour because we did't add file)

6.git add  (by using this command we can add single file)
  git add -A( using for adding multiple files)

7.git status (in this time our file colour changes to green)

8.git commit -m "added outside file"
(we must add comment to know the changes)

9.git push origin main
(by using this command we push our file from local to main in GitHub repository )
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        10.git pull codelink
(if we change any data in global repository it does't reflect to local file if we want the changes we can copy the https link in code and paste in cmd using this command)                                      
                                                   
11.git checkout -b (give branchname you want to send the data)   

12.git branch branchname (In cmd we can create new branch )
