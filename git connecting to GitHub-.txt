git connecting to GitHub:-
git config --global user.name username
git congif --global user.email emaild

check the username and mailid :-
git config user.name
git config user.email

create new folder in that folder go to address bar and delete the address and type cmd. cmd will open
 
we can change the directory with repository name:-
cd jrs_github(it is a git repository name)
dir
git status (it shows how many files are present in this folder)

we can also create new files in the local git and check using 
git status (then our file is visible in red colour because we did't add file)
git add -A (by using this command we add our file)
git status (in this time our file colour changes to green)
git commit -m "added outside file"(we must add comment to know )
git push origin main(by using this command we push our file from local to main in GitHub repository )
